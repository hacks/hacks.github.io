        <p>One of Hacks members’ favorite pastimes is trying to describe what Hacks is. Here are some that we think are memorable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>* Hacks is a place where cool people build cool stuff because it's cool</li>
            <li>* Tech tastemakers</li>
            <li>* We sit around and watch train videos</li>
            <li>* Social club for nerds</li>
            <li>* Hacks is like being swaddled inside of a maternity sweater while another person is also in that sweater. It’s warm and snuggly and of course you both fit</li>
            <li>* You know, we sit around, Hack the pentagon, usually with our ally, the hacker known as 4chan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If you want to add your own description come to a hacks meeting or email <a href="mailto:nuhacksboard@gmail.com">nuhacksboard@gmail.com</a></h3>
